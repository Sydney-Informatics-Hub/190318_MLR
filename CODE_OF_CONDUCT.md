<br>


The Sydney Informatics Hub is a Core Research Facility of the University of Sydney. SIH provides support, training, and expertise on research data, analyses and computing for research staff, students and affiliates of the University. We deliver policies, systems, advice, engineering and training to research staff, students and affiliates of the University.

We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing to our training materials. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in our activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by SIH including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

### The  Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in our activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by SIH including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which SIH resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

2.1 Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all SIH events and platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

2.2 Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any Carpentries event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs  
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any of our events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or appeal to the University of Sydney to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions. (Please note that it is also expected that you follow the University of Sydney's [Code of Conduct](http://sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2011/215&RendNum=0)).

### Incident Reporting Guidelines
1. Contact points

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during one of our events we ask that you report it to the event host, organiser, or a designated incident response person. The person you have talked to should make a report to SIH training about the incident by emailing [sih.training@sydney.edu.au](mailto:sih.training@sydney.edu.au). If this is not possible for some reason, we would be very grateful if you could report the incident yourself.

If a violation occurs in an online space outside of organised events, please email sih.training@sydney.edu.au about the incident.

1.2 What to do if someone is in physical danger

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please ask a staff member or volunteer to contact appropriate emergency responders. All event organizers should, before the event, determine who it would be appropriate to contact in case of an incident.

Once the incident has been resolved, we ask that it be reported to the Code of Conduct committee in the same way as all other incidences.
