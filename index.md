**Synopsis:** Introduces USyd’s High Performance Computer (HPC), ‘Artemis’. We cover connecting and navigating Artemis, available software, and how to submit and monitor jobs using the PBS Pro scheduler..

**Target audience:** Students and staff who would like to learn how to run compute jobs on Artemis HPC. Participants must have a valid USyd unikey.

**Follow-on courses:** This course is designed as a 2-part session, with ‘_Introduction to the Artemis HPC_’ in the morning and ‘_Data transfer and RDS for HPC_’ in the afternoon. It is recommended to register for both, however you may choose to take these courses on separate days as suits your needs.

‘_Intermediate Artemis HPC_’ extends students knowledge of the PBS Pro scheduling system, and builds scripting skills for automating large workflows on HPC.
